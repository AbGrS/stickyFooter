That’s a different thing that this was true about 100 million years ago, \
when dinosaurs used to exist, but it is true, that’s what matters. \
Then about 50 million years ago the Indian continental plate collided with that of \
Asia’s thus forming Himalayas.\
Bonus Fact: the plate still continues to move northward being the reason of \
Mount Everest’s growing height every year.\

      Officially known as the Republic of India\

     second most populated country. \
     It is also the largest democracy of the world. \
     These are some things that everybody knows about India. \

Mount Everest’s growing height every year.\
